Task1. The 2-dimensional lattice generated by vectors u,v consists of the points au+bv for all integers a,b. 
Considering vectors u,v and an integer k>0 as input parameters, write a program creating a planar graph 
of a lattice generated by u,v, whose vertices are the origin (0,0) and only its k closest neighbours among 
the lattice points, while any vertices related by a translation by only u, v, u+v or u-v should be connected 
by a straight-line edge. If you program in Python, you could import networkx as nx.

Task2. Install the OpenCV library (for Python) from opencv.org and complete tutorials at 
https://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/d98/tutorial_mat_operations.html and 
https://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/d96/tutorial_basic_geometric_drawing.html. 
Use OpenCV to draw the graph from the previous exercise for k=50 and the 
hexagonal lattice generated by u=(1,0) and v=(0.5,root(3)/2). For example, 
you could use the white background and the functions line and circle for blue edges (thickness 1)
and red vertices (disks of radius 2). The code is required as a txt file and a png image of the resulting 
lattice graph, also a png image of the piecewise linear graph of the distance function through the 
points (k,d_k),k=1,...,50, where d_k is the distance from the origin to its k-th neighbour in the lattice.
